## Achieved Goals
- Implemented user login and registration with role-based access (supplier/customer).
- Developed a robust cart system for adding/removing parts before checkout.
- Created an order mechanism storing purchases in the database.
- Implemented search and filter features (by price and manufacturer).
- Added profile management allowing password updates.
- Set up logging for errors and user actions.

## Missed Goals
- Automated testing or unit tests (e.g., pytest) to ensure reliability.
- Continuous integration or deployment pipelines for smoother releases.
- Real payment gateway integration (current implementation uses “pending”/“paid” status).
- More advanced performance optimization and caching strategies.
- Additional analytics or reporting features for suppliers.
