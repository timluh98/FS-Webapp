## Future Improvements
- **Performance Tuning**: Optimize page load times by introducing caching for static content and adopting efficient database querying strategies.
- **Automated Testing**: Implement a comprehensive testing framework (e.g., pytest) to catch regressions early and ensure code reliability.
- **Continuous Integration & Deployment**: Enable CI/CD pipelines to automate builds, testing, and deployments, reducing manual effort and risk of errors.
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Provide user-friendly feedback for common errors (e.g., form submission issues) and log them carefully for swift debugging.
- **Search & Filter User Experience**: Refine the filtering interface to include more product attributes (e.g., brand, condition) and display results dynamically.
- **UI Customization**: Expand the siteâ€™s look and feel with more themes or color-scheme options, offering a variety of UI styles to end users.

## Teamwork & Evaluation
- **Clearer Role Definition**: Establish explicit milestones and tasks for each team member, reducing overlap and confusion.
- **More Frequent Check-ins**: Organize short stand-up meetings to align progress, address roadblocks, and share updates regularly.
- **Joint Code Reviews**: Conduct collaborative review sessions for major features, promoting shared ownership and consistent coding standards.
- **Shared Documentation**: Encourage writing or updating docs together to ensure everyone understands functionalities and best practices.
