## 01: Supplier Part Management Workflow

### Meta

Status
: **Done**

Updated
: 15-Jan-2024

### Goal

Evaluate the effectiveness and usability of the part management workflow for suppliers, including part creation, editing, and inventory management. Key questions:
- How intuitive is the part creation process?
- Can suppliers effectively manage their inventory?
- Are the status updates (availability, deletion, restoration) working as intended?

### Method

1. Recruited 2 motorcycle parts suppliers for testing
2. Asked them to perform the following tasks:
   - Create a new part listing with image
   - Edit an existing part's details
   - Archive and restore a part
   - Update inventory quantities
3. Used think-aloud protocol during testing
4. Collected completion times and success rates
5. Gathered qualitative feedback through post-task interviews

### Results

1. Task Completion Rates:
   - Part creation: 100% (avg time: 4.2 minutes)
   - Part editing: 100% (avg time: 2.1 minutes)
   - Archive/restore: 90% (one user initially confused by terminology)
   - Inventory updates: 100% (avg time: 1.5 minutes)

2. Key Findings:
   - Image upload was intuitive but some users wanted multiple image support
   - Automatic availability status updates were appreciated
   - Archive function preferred over permanent deletion
   - Part restoration workflow was clear and effective

3. Pain Points:
   - Bulk inventory updates not supported
   - No preview of listing before submission
   - Limited image editing capabilities

### Implications

1. Immediate Changes:
   - Add preview functionality for new listings
   - Clarify archive/restore terminology in UI
   - Implement batch inventory update feature

2. Future Improvements:
   - Add multiple image support
   - Implement basic image editing tools
   - Add bulk operation features for inventory management

3. Follow-up:
   - Schedule re-evaluation after implementing immediate changes
   - Plan long-term monitoring of supplier satisfaction metrics
